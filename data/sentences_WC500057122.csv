Quality The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.
Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.
"There are no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product."
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology The non clinical pharmacological programme provided a good characterisation of the pharmacological properties  of  rivaroxaban.
Pharmacodynamic  receptor  binding  and  enzyme  inhibition  investigations adequately demonstrate that rivaroxaban is a selective FXa inhibitor and that pharmacological effects due to interaction with unrelated receptors or enzymes are unlikely.
Inhibition  of  FXa  leads  to  secondary  changes  in  coagulation  parameters  such  as  aPTT  and  PT.
Efficacy  was  demonstrated  in  various  thrombotic  models  and  in  general  there  appears  to  be  a  dose margin  between  the  antithrombotic  effect  and  the  risk  for  increased  bleeding.
"Safety  pharmacology studies do not suggest any acute adverse exaggerated pharmacological effects of rivaroxaban, except bleeding and this was confirmed in the clinical environment."
Rivaroxaban  has  a  structural  similarity  to  the  antibiotic  linezolid  and  therefore  might  exhibit  a potential  for  inhibition  of  the  bacterial  protein  synthesis.
"An  additional,  related,  concern  is  the possibility  of  mitochondrial  toxicity,  since  linezolid  is  known  to  inhibit  mitochondrial  protein synthesis  leading  to  a  loss  of  mitochondrial  function."
"No  antibacterial  activity  was  shown  for rivaroxaban  ,  however,  the  potential  risk  for  mitochondrial  toxicity  is  not  ruled  out."
This  does  not represent  a  considerable  risk  for  the  approved  short-term  indication.
"In  order  to  provide  further clarifications, mitochondrial toxicity of rivaroxaban is planned to be addressed in further nonclinical investigation, which is particularly relevant in case of considering an extension to long-term treatment in the future."
The  drug  interaction  investigations  did  not  indicate  any  specific  concerns.
Some  additive  effects  on bleeding  were  observed  in  concomitant  administration  of  rivaroxaban  with  antihaemostatic  drugs.
"There is a potential for the recombinant factor VII to serve as rivaroxaban antidotes, but this has not been confirmed in clinical settings."
The pharmacokinetic and metabolic profile of rivaroxaban are well characterised.
"The  increased  incidence  of  pancreatic  lesions  in  animals  and  adverse  effects  on  liver,  including changes  of  hepatic  enzyme  and  bilirubin  levels  and  incidence  of  liver  necrosis,  observed  in  non clinical studies are thought to be found in the human trials, e.g."
"increased lipase, amylase and hepatic enzyme  levels."
"Furthermore,  some  teratogenic  effects  were  seen  at  clinically  relevant  exposure affecting  mainly  skeleton,  heart  and  vessels."
"In  addition,  true  placenta  and  teratogenic  effects  of rivaroxaban  cannot  be  excluded."
Reduced  viability  of  the  offsprings  was  observed  at  the  doses  that to  dams.
Pregnancy  and  breastfeeding  during  rivaroxaban  administration  are were contraindicated.
The  relevant toxicity  and teratogenicity are included in the SPC.
"information  on  placental toxicity,  embryofoetal toxic The environmental risk of rivaroxaban was assessed and the CHMP concluded that there is no need for a phase II assessment in frame of the currently planned use of rivaroxaban."
"Clinical pharmacology Rivaroxaban has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile with several elimination pathways (about 36% renal excretion, 32% CYP-mediated metabolism and 14% hydrolysis) and a fairly small risk for major increases  in  exposure."
Rivaroxaban  exposure  is  increased  to  a  significant  extent  in  patients  with moderate hepatic impairment and in patients receiving concomitant medication with dual inhibitors of CYP3A4  and  P-gp.
Data  are  lacking  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  associated  with  impaired haemostasis  and  in  end  stage  renal  disease  patients  (creatinine  clearance  <15  ml/min).
Appropriate EMEA 2008 warnings  and  recommendations  have  been  included  in  the  SPC  for  patients  at  risk  for  increased exposure.
The  applicant  has  ongoing  activities  to  further  investigate  the  possibility  to  develop  a laboratory test that could be used for monitoring patients at increased risk for bleeding.
"Efficacy The dose finding, phase II studies in VTE prevention setting were performed with the doses ranging from 2.5 mg bid to 30 mg bid and a with the doses range from 5 mg od to 40 mg od."
Data indicated a target  therapeutic  window  of  5  mg  to  20  mg  total  daily  dose  in  the  prevention  of  VTE  after  major orthopedic surgery.
Total daily doses of 20 mg and beyond were associated with a higher incidence of bleeding events and there was only an evidence for small differences in efficacy between the 5 mg bid and the 10 mg od dosing regimens.
Higher compliance to treatment a possible better safety profile of the  10 mg od  dosing  regimen  in  comparison  with  the  5  mg  bid  regimen  can  be  expected.
Further investigations confirmed that the optimal net clinical benefit (avoidance of major VTE and/or major bleeding)  was  observed  in  the  10  mg  od  dose.
The  use  of  the  once-daily  dose  of  10  mg  was  thus adequately  justified  and  was  selected  for  investigations  in  phase  III  studies  in  the  VTE  prevention indication.
The  pivotal  phase  III  studies  had  a  conventional  design  for  new  agents  within this  therapeutic  area.
"Two  independent  comparative  studies,  one  in  hip  surgery  and  one  in  knee  surgery  have  been performed."
The study populations were representative of a target population undergoing elective major orthopaedic  surgery  of  the  lower  limbs.
"The  rivaroxaban  regimens  were  superior  to  the  well established  enoxaparin  regimens  with  regard  to  the  composite  primary  efficacy  parameter (venographically detected total VTEs, symptomatic VTEs and death) and the results were supported by different sensitivity analyses."
"Superiority was also demonstrated for a more stringent endpoint of major  VTEs  consistent  with  the  CHMP  guidance  recommendations,  excluding  asymptomatic  distal VTEs)."
"As expected, the rates of symptomatic VTE events were low and these results were consistent with the primary efficacy results."
A supportive study comparing a 5 week prophylactic rivaroxaban regimen with a conventional 2 week enoxaparin regimen in elective hip surgery demonstrated superiority of the rivaroxaban regimen.
Hip fracture patients were not included in the clinical study programme.
The proposed indication was therefore found to be not acceptable by the CHMP.
It is expected that rivaroxaban would be effective in  the  hip  fracture  surgery.
There  are  higher  VTE  rates  in  hip  fracture  surgery  as  compared  to  the elective hip surgery.
Marked differences in the overall mortality rates with higher mortality among the fracture  patients  and  a  clear  tendency  to  the  higher  incidence  of  fatal  PEs  are  also  relevant  for  this patient  population.
"As  a  group,  fracture  patients  are  of  advanced  age  and  more  fragile,  and  have  a larger risk of concomitant diseases."
Rivaroxaban represents a fairly new pharmacological concept and some  uncertainties  with  regard  to  the  safety  of  the  drug  when  used  in  the  routine  clinical  setting remain.
Specific controlled efficacy and safety data from patients with hip fracture were not available.
"Given the different risk profile for these patients, the current indication of rivaroxaban was restricted by the CHMP to adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery."
Rivaroxaban is not recommended for use in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.
Safety The  safety  profile  of  rivaroxaban  in  the  proposed  dose  for  up  to  5  weeks  treatment  has  been  well characterised and no major safety concerns have been identified so far.
A relatively large number of subjects were exposed to rivaroxaban.
Safety population in phase III studies comprises 4657 subjects randomized to rivaroxaban and 4692 subjects randomized to enoxaparin.
"Since the product is currently proposed  for  an  exposure  not  longer  than  35  days,  safety  data  with regard  to  long-term  exposure  is limited."
"Only  limited  data  concerning  the  exposure  of  >35±4  days  is  available  at  this  time  point, however, no different safety profile became obvious during assessment of this data in comparison to short term treatment (<35±4 days)."
"Safety  aspects  such  as  bleeding  events,  cardiovascular  events  and  liver  enzyme  elevations  were analysed and assessed."
The main safety endpoint during phase II and III studies was the incidence of treatment emergent major bleeding observed not later than 2 days after last intake of study drug.
"EMEA 2008 The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events in phase III controlled clinical studies in  both  treatment  groups  during  both  treatment  periods  were  gastrointestinal  disorders,  in  particular nausea, vomiting, and constipation; general disorders, in particular pyrexia; procedural complications such as postoperative  anaemia  and  procedural pain."
"The  most  frequently  reported  serious  treatment-emergent,  drug-related  adverse  events  in  both  treatment  groups  during  both  treatment  periods  were increased  ALT,  operative  haemorrhage,  vascular  disorders,  and  haematoma."
No  differences  of relevance concerning type of adverse events between all phases of the clinical trial program became obvious.
Similar  rates  and  profiles  of  discontinuation  of  treatment  because  of  adverse  events  between rivaroxaban  treatment  and  treatment  with  the  comparator  enoxaparin  were  observed.
Overall  death rate  was  within  the  range  expected  from  literature  and  no  specific  safety  signal  could  be  identified form  the  assessment  of  deaths  in  this  application.
Haemorrhage  (surgical  and  extra-surgical  site haemorrhages) is considered an identified risk.
"The incidence rate of major bleeding was comparable between  the  two  treatment  groups,  but  the  bleeding  overall  events  were  numerically  higher  in  the rivaroxaban  group  in  comparison  to  enoxaparin."
"The  potential  for  increased  bleeding  risk  for rivaroxaban still exists, especially in cases of incidental overdose or inappropriate off-label use."
Such issues  are  addressed  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan.
There  is  a  trend  towards  higher  bleeding  event rates  for  subjects  outside  of  normal  body  weight  range  when  compared  with  enoxaparin  treatment.
"Elderly  (>  75  years)  and  fragile  subjects  tended  to  have  a  lower  risk  for  bleeding  events  with rivaroxaban,  but  in  both  cases,  the  observations  are  based  on  overall  low  event  rates  and  no  dose adjustment was needed."
At present no specific antidote is available for rivaroxaban.
"Overall  from  the  presented  subgroups  analyses  of  bleeding  events  in  the  three  phase  III  trials,  no evidence  was  found,  to  restrict  the  use  of  rivaroxaban  10  mg  od  according  to  gender,  age  and bodyweight."
In patients with different stages of renal impairment an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlating to the  decrease  in  renal  function  was  observed.
"Furthermore,  a  higher  number  of  bleeding  events  was seen in subjects with severe renal impairment."
"Therefore, as advised in the SPC, rivaroxaban is not to be  used  in  patients  with  creatinine  clearance  <15  ml/min  and  must  be  used  with  caution  in  patients with  severe  renal  impairment  as  well  as  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  concomitantly receiving other medication increasing rivaroxaban plasma concentrations."
No specific safety signal concerning cardiovascular safety was derived from the clinical data.
"In order to avoid a potential increase in the pharmacodynamic effect, rivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients  with  hepatic  disease  associated  with  coagulopathy  and  a  clinically  relevant  bleeding  risk."
Caution is advised in patients with other hepatic disease of moderate grade.
Safety recommendations with regard to patients  with  hepatic impairment  are reflected in the  SPC.
The use  of  rivaroxaban in cirrhotic  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  resulted  in  an  increased  drug  exposure  in comparison with healthy volunteers.
"Observations of transient increases of serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin as well as increases in serum lipase  and  amylase  in  patients  undergoing  major  orthopaedic  surgery  are  reflected  in  the  adverse reaction  section  of  the  SPC."
"In  most  cases,  these  were  asymptomatic  elevations."
Single  cases  of symptomatic liver impairment and non-serious pancreatitis have been reported in the clinical studies.
"There is, however, no clear evidence that rivaroxaban was the causative agent in these cases."
"Rivaroxaban is not recommended for treatment of patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with  azole-antimycotics  such  as  ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  voriconazole  and  posaconazole  or  the HIV  protease  inhibitors  due  to  their  interactions  with  cytochrome  P450  and  P-gp  resulting  in  a potential  to  increase  bleeding  risk."
"Furthermore,  care  must  be  taken  when  co-administering rivaroxaban and other anti-coagulants due to the possible increase of bleeding."
From  the  safety  database  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  have  been  included  in  the Summary of Product Characteristics[0] based on a pre-defined algorithm.
"Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these concerns."
EMEA 2008 •  User consultation User  testing  of  the  Package  Leaflet  was  performed  in  August  and  September  2007  in  English.
"Following  a  pilot  round  the  Package  Leaflet  was  tested  in  two  test  rounds,  with  a  total  of  20  test persons (healthy volunteers and orthopaedic surgery patients with even distribution of gender, age 50-79)."
The  questionnaire  covered  the  key  safety  issues  of  the  PL.
The  methodology  followed  the Readability guideline.
The PL was revised following a pilot round as well as the test rounds 1 and 2.
Considering the overall results of the two rounds the result is in line with the requirements.
"In conclusion, the user testing is judged acceptable."
"Risk-benefit assessment Based  on  the  outcome  of  the  clinical  development  programme  and  the  reduced  occurrence  of thromboembolic  events  in  subjects  treated  with  rivaroxaban,  the  number  of  patients  in  need  of therapeutic  anticoagulant  treatment  in  the  target  population  may  be  reduced  by  approximately  50% when compared to the approved enoxaparin regimen."
"Considering the risks and practical difficulties with such treatment, this reduction is considered to be beneficial."
There is a potential for rivaroxaban to  further  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  venous  thromboembolism  related  complications.
"It  is important to note that hip fracture patients were not included in the clinical study programme and this is  reflected  in  the  wording  of  the  amended,  restricted  indication  and  appropriately  addressed  in  the SPC."
Structural  similarity  of  rivaroxaban  with  linezolid  have  raised  a  concern  regarding  potential mitochondrial  toxicity  of  rivaroxaban.
"Although  non-clinical  studies  cannot  completely  rule  out  a potential for risk for mitochondrial damage of rivaroxaban, in vitro-studies addressing mitochondrial protein  synthesis  showed  that  the  potential  for  mitochondrial  toxicity  might  be  low  and  thus  not expected to be of concern for the currently approved short-term treatment with rivaroxaban."
"However, any mitochondrial toxicity is of greater concern if the product is to be used long-term."
"Therefore, due to limitations of the in vitro study, this issue will be explored further in nonclinical setting specifically addressing mitochondrial toxicity."
Rivaroxaban exposure is increased to a significant extent in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and in patients receiving concomitant medication with dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp.
Data are not available from patients with hepatic impairment associated with impaired haemostasis and in end stage renal disease patients (creatinine clearance <15 ml/min).
"There are, however, proposed activities to further investigate the possibility to develop a laboratory test that could be used in routine clinical setting for monitoring patients at increased risk for bleeding."
The results from these activities will be provided to the CHMP in frame of a follow-up measure.
"If possible, appropriate recommendations in the SPC including methodology for monitoring patients at increased risk for bleeding might be needed."
No major safety concerns have been identified.
Prophylaxis with rivaroxaban might be associated with a slightly higher bleeding tendency than the approved enoxaparin regimen but no major differences are apparent at this point in time.
The number of serious bleedings did not differ substantially between the treatment groups in the clinical studies.
No clear signals for hepatic or renal adverse events induced by rivaroxaban have been identified.
"However, such adverse events will be kept under close surveillance in the post-marketing observational study and in the future Periodic Safety Update Reports."
The benefit/risk balance was considered to be positive by the CHMP.
An oral treatment without the need  for  dose  titration  or  monitoring  would  represent  an  important  alternative  to  the  conventional subcutaneous  prophylactic  therapy.
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  rivaroxaban  therapy  in  proposed doses  is  more  effective  than  the  approved  enoxaparin  regimen  possibly  at  the  price  of  a  slightly increased bleeding tendency.
A risk management plan was submitted.
"The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:  (cid:131)  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns."
EMEA 2008 (cid:131)  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.
"Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Xarelto in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation."
