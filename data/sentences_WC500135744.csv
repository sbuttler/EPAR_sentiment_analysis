"Aflibercept is exempted from an environmental risk assessment, because it is a protein and therefore unlikely to result in a significant environmental risk.2.3.6."
"Discussion on non-clinical aspectsThe nonclinical studies were designed to evaluate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of VEGF Trap in support of clinical intravitreal (IVT) treatment of VEGF Trap."
"Studies were conducted in vitro (PD) and in mice, rats, rabbit and monkeys, and their scope is considered to be extensive and adequate.In order to provide proof of concept and mode of action, the binding of VEGF Trap and effect of phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 have been characterised in in vitro and in vivo studies."
"The assumption that identical or near identical protein sequences are predictive of very similar, if not identical, binding affinities of monkey and human VEGF-A/PlGF has been supported by additional data provided by the Applicant in their responses to the CHMP questions."
"The pharmacology studies were acceptable, and the Applicant has shown that the binding of VEGF Trap is selective, even within the VEGF family of ligands."
It is agreed that binding of VEGF Trap to ‘non-target’ protein ligands is unlikely.
"Regarding the safety pharmacology, VEGF Trap had no effect on respiratory function or thrombus formation, and no effects on the central nervous system were detected in toxicological studies, even when VEGF Trap was administered at high doses systemically for several months."
"Concerning the cardiovascular system, the effect of VEGF Trap on blood pressure was assessed after single subcutaneous injections of 2, 5 and 25 mg/kg in telemetered C57BL/6 mice (VGFT-MX-08018) and from 0.05 to 25 mg/kg in telemetered Wistar-Kyoto rats (VGFD-MX-08015)."
Administration of VEGF Trap resulted in a statistically significant increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure dose dependent and lasting several days.
"In the opposite, single or repeated subcutaneous or intravenous injection of VEGF Trap in Cynomolgus monkey do not change blood pressure levels."
"It was concluded that the lack of an effect of VEGF Trap on blood pressure is most probably due to the effects of chemical/physical restraint on the cardiovascular system of the Cynomolgus monkeys and the limited sensitivity of indirect blood pressure measurement systems as compared to direct, e.g."
radiotelemetry techniques which have been used in rodents.
"CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 23/83Data from formal pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies of VEGF Trap with ophthalmic anaesthetic agents, antimicrobial agents and mydriatics is not available."
"This was considered acceptable, as topical ocular medications do not reach the posterior segment and drug-drug interactions with VEGF Trap within this ocular compartment are therefore unlikely."
"In addition, the clinical experience included prior administration of topical mydriatic agents and concomitant topical administration of anaesthetics and disinfectant antimicrobials with intravitreal injection of VEGF Trap Eye, which were well-tolerated.Concerning the pharmacokinetic aspects, SC bioavailability was good in mice (94%) and monkeys (85%) and moderate in rats (33%)."
"Following IVT administration to monkeys, VEGF Trap systemic absorption appears to be relatively high."
Tissue distribution following IV administration of [125I]-VEGF Trap to rats supported the assertion that distribution was limited primarily to the circulation.
"The highest concentration of tissue radioactivity was localized in the liver, followed by other highly perfused tissues."
No studies were conducted on metabolism.
"Renal excretion of VEGF Trap is insignificant.Regarding the toxicological aspects, the only treatment related post mortem findings observed in the chronic study by intravitreal administration to monkeys were epithelial erosions and/or ulcerations with chronic active inflammation of the nasal turbinates."
"The SmPC section 4.6 incorporates a warning about women of childbearing potential, following the findings in the rabbit reproductive studies.The fact that it was possible to reach only 6-times the clinical exposure levels in the monkey intravitreal studies was discussed in CHMP scientific advice and considered acceptable due to the limitations in the formulation of the product, increasing volume or frequency of administration."
No significant pharmacodynamic differences are expected between monkeys and humans because the VEGF molecules are identical in humans and monkeys.
"Regarding the antibody formation to VEGF Trap, in preclinical IVT studies, very few animals were positive in the ADA assay and only 1 animal generated a response that appeared to impact PK."
Animals with ADA responses that did not affect plasma drug levels did not exhibit these ocular findings.
"It is noted that immunogenicity in monkeys is not predictive of immunogenicity in humans, although the very low immunogenicity observed in monkeys was also observed in humans."
"Following extended intravitreal administration of VEGF Trap in clinical trials, positivity rates in the ADA assay were similar in patients regardless of treatment (VEGF Trap or ranibizumab)."
"The CHMP concluded that, based on the available data, there is no indication that IVT administration of VEGF Trap in patients would elicit a serious immune response.2.3.7."
"Conclusion on the non-clinical aspectsIn conclusion, VEGF Trap had no effect on respiratory function or thrombus formation, and no effects on the central nervous system or cardiac function were detected in toxicological studies, even when VEGF Trap was administered at high doses systemically for several months."
"However, repeated systemic administration of VEGF Trap did impair the rate and/or extent of healing of both incisional and excisional wounds in rabbits, in a dose related manner, at all doses tested (0.3, 3 and 30 mg/kg/administration)."
Impairment of wound healing is also a class effect of VEGF inhibitors.A pregnancy warning is included in Section 4.6 of the SmPC.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 24/832.4.
Clinical aspects2.4.1.

The final integrated inspection report was issued on 6 February 2012.
"According to the GCP final integrated inspection report, the outcome of this inspection is satisfactory."
"The inspected investigator sites appeared to be GCP compliant and it was nothing identified to suggest that the data collected at the sites are unreliable.The Inspection report do not suggest that the deficiencies/findings observed during the course of inspections may impact on the results of the study and according to the recommendation for use of the inspected data, the inspected data of clinical trial 311 523 (VIEW 2) are of an acceptable quality to be used for the evaluation by the assessors in connection with the marketing authorisation application for Eylea.Tabular overview of clinical studies Summary of clinical studies in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 25/83PhaseStudyDescriptionRoute/DoseFrequencySubjects/StatusIPDY6656 Phase I, single centre study to assess cardiovascular PD and PKIV; Single dose1, 2, 4 mg/kg, placebo48 healthy volunteersCompleted40 healthy volunteersCompleted26 AMD patientsCompletedPDY6655Phase I, single-centre study to compare cardiovascular PD and PKIV & SC;2 mg/kgVGFT-OD-0305Phase I, exploratory study of the safety, tolerability and biological activitymg/kg, placeboSingle doseRepeat dose (4 doses q2w)IV;IV;VGFT-OD-0306Phase I, safety and tolerability study (open label extension of VGFT-OD-0305)0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg, placeboRepeat dose (q2w)7 AMD patientsCompletedVGFT-OD-0502 Part A, B, C (CLEAR-IT 1)Phase I, exploratory study of the safety tolerability and biological effect2, 4 mgIVT;Single and repeat dose49 AMD patientsVGFT-OD-0603 (CLEAR-IT 1b)Phase I study to assess the safety and tolerability of VEGF Trap in the ITV-1 and ITV-2 formulationsIVT;4 mgIIVGFT-OD-0508 (CLEAR-IT 2)Phase II study of the safety, tolerability and biological effectIVT;0.5, 2, 4 mg (in Part C two doses q8w, with optional monthly dosing for 1 year extension period)CompletedRepeat dose(3 doses q4w)20 AMD patientsCompletedRepeat dose(0.5/2 mg q4w, 0.5/2/4 mg q12w, prn dosing from Week 12 to Week 52)157 AMD patientsCompletedRepeat dose(Year 1: 0.5/2 mg q4w or 2 mg q8w; Year 2  q4w-q12w)1038 AMD patientsCompletedRepeat dose(Year 1: 0.5/2 mg q4w or 2 mg q8w; Year 2  q4w-q12w)1025 AMD patientsCompletedVGFT-OD-0702IVT; 2 mgRepeat dose120 AMD patients(q8w for 39 months)CompletedPhase I/II long-term safety extension study, with PK sub-study."

"PharmacokineticsAbsorption, Distribution, EliminationPKs of VEGF Trap could be considered well characterized based on the investigations performed by systemic (mainly IV but also SC) route as well as by IVT (intra-vitreal) routes."
"These investigations consisted in six Phase I, two Phase II and one Phase III studies."
Studies by systemic route were performed in healthy volunteers and patients.
Studies by IVT route were conducted in patients.Analytical techniques.
The analytical techniques used through the PK development programme were described and validated.
The earlier colorimetric versions of the ELISA techniques used for the determination of free and bound VEGF Trap levels from clinical studies involving systemic CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 26/83administration of VEGF Trap were modified to luminescence based ELISAs which were used to analyze systemic levels of free and bound VEGF Trap in AMD clinical studies involving IVT administration of VEGF Trap.
The analytical techniques used in the IV and IVT were not formally cross-validated.
"Therefore, the inter-study comparisons should be regarded cautiously."
Adequate methods were used for pharmacokinetic and statistical data analysis.Analysis of different formulations and processes.
"During the development of VEGF Trap, to improve stability, the drug substance was manufactured using three different processes (IVT P1, P2 and P3) and two formulations of the drug product for IVT administration of VEGF Trap were developed."
"Subsequently, the different formulations were evaluated with respect to pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity, in order to demonstrate comparability between the various process and IVT formulations."
"Considering that VEGF Trap is intended for local administration, the contribution of the systemic exposure in the assessment of the comparability of the different process (active substance) and formulations (drug product) is limited."
"Reassuringly, the final formulation and process were used for the preparation of the lots tested in the pivotal phase III studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2)."
"As a consequence, the comparability of early process (active substance) and formulations (drug product) was not of concern."
The pharmacodynamic and clinical investigations (see relevant parts) revealed no difference between products issued from different process and formulations.Systemic route.
The investigation by systemic route confirmed that VEGF Trap PK behaviour is consistent with that generally observed with large proteins.
The VEGF Trap Vd following IV administration is close to plasma volume.
"At plasma level, VEGF-trap binds to endogenous free VEGF with high affinity to form an inert complex."
"Due to the saturation of this binding to endogenous VEGF, Free VEGF-trap exhibits a non-linear PK."
"Data suggests that free VEGF Trap is cleared by relatively rapid, specific and saturable high-affinity binding to VEGF as well as via slower, non-saturable clearance mechanisms."
"These latter mechanisms are expected to be proteolytic catabolism processes, which affect both free and bound VEGF Trap."
"The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of free VEGF Trap was approximately 1.9 days following an IV dose of 0.3 mg/kg, and increased with increasing doses, reaching t1/2 estimates of 5 to 6 days after IV administration of doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg VEGF Trap."
The systemic exposure to the free VEGF-Trap observed at the clinical MTD i.e.
1mg administered by the IV route is approximately 10 to 20 (µg/mL) for Cmax and 50-80 (day*µg/mL).
The systemic exposure observed with the first toxic dose i.e.
2 mg by IV route is 45 ± 36 (µg/mL) for Cmax and 180 ±33 (day*µg/mL) approximately.Intravitreal route.
"Since VEGF Trap is administered directly into the target site of pharmacological activity, the eye, the bioavailability within the target organ is assumed to be 100%."
"Following IVT administration of VEGF Trap, a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind to free endogenous VEGF in the eye to form a stable, high affinity VEGF:VEGF-Trap complex."
Excess free VEGF Trap is available to bind newly synthesized VEGF in the eye or endogenously available VEGF in the central compartment.
"VEGF Trap is slowly absorbed from the eye into the systemic circulation after IVT administration and is predominantly observed in the systemic circulation as an inactive, stable complex with VEGF."
In most patients plasma levels of free VEGF-Trap were below the LLOQ.
Some measurable plasma levels (up to 0.473 µg/mL) were actually observed in patients.
"Based on Cmax comparison the highest level observed in the clinical Phase III study VIEW2 is 200-250 times lower than that observed with the MTD (1 mg, IV route) and approximately 100 times lower than that observed with the first toxic dose (2 mg by IV route)."
"Therefore, the level of this exposure is deemed to be too low to lead to significant systemic (non-ocular) side effects."
"However this needs to be confirmed by safety clinical data.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 27/83Dose proportionality and time dependenciesData obtained with the IV route showed that Free VEGF Trap exhibits non-linear PK consistent with saturable, target-mediated drug disposition."
"However, this is not relevant for the IVT route.Data from phase III study (VIEW 2) revealed no unexpected accumulation at plasma level of VEGF Trap  after repeated IVT administration (up to 1 year).Special populationsAge, sex, body mass index (BMI), renal function, hepatic function and ethnicity are not expected to influence the plasma concentrations of free and bound VEGF Trap.Pharmacokinetic interaction studiesConsidering the administration pathway (IVT) and the very low systemic level of VEGF trap, neither in vitro nor in vivo interactions studies have been performed.Since the systemic exposure to both free and bound VEGF Trap following intravitreal injection is low, the potential for drug interactions is low."
"In addition, systemic or topically applied drugs usually reach the vitreous cavity in very low concentrations, so interactions within the eye are also unlikely."
"However, some clinicians may manage AMD with concomitant therapies, such as verteporfin with PDT or use off label intraocular steroids."
"The potential for such treatments to influence the intraocular effect of VEGF Trap has not been appropriately addressed in the documentation provided, therefore clarifying statements have been inserted in the section 4.5 of Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials the SmPC.None.2.4.3."
PharmacodynamicsNo specific studies dedicated to human pharmacodynamics have been performed for aflibercept.
"The pharmacodynamics data derive from in vitro, animal and human efficacy studies."
VEGF Trap (aflibercept) exerts inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and stabilizing actions on vessel permeability through the blocking of VEGF-A.
"IVT injection permits direct targeting of the areas of abnormal neovascularization in the retina, and this route of administration is considered as the more relevant for retinal pathologies."
"In addition, the IVT route of administration also permits to decrease systemic toxicity linked to anti-VEGF activity."
Mechanism of actionAflibercept belongs to the pharmacological class of VEGF inhibitors.
"The role of VEGF in promoting pathological neovascularization and/or abnormal and excessive vascular permeability in several diseases affecting the eye is now well established.Primary and Secondary pharmacologyPrimary pharmacology: The clinical pharmacology programme consists of phase I and II studies that were designed to explore, in patients suffering from wet AMD, the bioeffects of VEGF Trap on the retina."
"Central CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 28/83retinal/lesion thickness and CNV lesion size were assessed using Optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography (FA) as pharmacodynamic endpoints, concomitantly with evolution of visual acuity (according to the ETDRS Chart)."
"Retinal thickness is an accepted PD marker for neovascular AMD, but it is known to have a variable correlation with visual acuity.IV injections were firstly explored in studies VGTF OD 305-306-307; a favourable trend of improvements in central retinal thickness and visual acuity at the VEGF Trap dose levels of 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg was identified in Study VGTF OD 305."
"Single and repeated IVT injections of escalating doses of VEGF Trap (0.05 to 4 mg) were further explored in VGTF OD 502, VGTF OD 508 and VGFT-OD-0603 studies, and were shown to reduce both retinal thickness and the size of the CNV lesion, in a dose-proportional fashion.In these studies central retinal thickness was not always well correlated with visual acuity."
An important lack of correlation was specifically observed in study VGTF OD 508 at the end of the fixed dosing phase and at Week 16 for the 4 mg dose administered every 12 weeks.
"This is thought to be probably related to the high variability observed in the results for prolonged interval duration beyond 8-week.Bioeffects were also explored as secondary or additional outcome measures using FA and OCT measurements, in pivotal studies VIEW 1 and VIEW 2."
"After treatment initiation, retinal thickness decreased > 100 microns and reduced mean CNV lesion size were observed, consistent with the results seen in phase I and II studies.Secondary pharmacology:Systemic VEGF inhibition is known to cause dose-related increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure."
"Although this was observed in subjects following IV and SC dosing with VEGF Trap at all dose levels between 0.3 and 3 mg/kg, no such changes were detected when VEGF Trap was administered intravitreally."
This is likely to be due to the low amounts of free VEGF Trap reaching the systemic circulation (approximately 50 ng/mL).
The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km – the concentration of free VEGF Trap corresponding to the half-maximal binding capacity) value was calculated to be 2.91 μg/mL for free VEGF Trap binding to human VEGF.The Applicant considered that the increase risk of blood pressure in the target population is unlikely.
"However, 15-20% of aflibercept passes to the systemic circulation and during the pivotal studies, hypertension have been reported in 14.6% patients."
The CHMP considered that systemic side effect on blood pressure should not be ruled out and need to be further monitored even if the product is locally administered.
This is identified as an important potential risk in the RMP.2.4.4.
Discussion on clinical pharmacologyIntravitreal VEGF Trap has been shown to reduce both retinal thickness and CNV lesion size in patients with neovascular AMD in a dose-proportional fashion.
"Furthermore, the data suggest that dosing every 12 weeks may be insufficient to maintain these improvements, and that more frequent dosing may be required."
"Visual acuity results from the Phase II studies were more variable, and as a whole the data suggest no additional benefit of the 4 mg dose over a 2 mg dose."
"There is minimal systemic exposure to VEGF Trap following intravitreal administration, making systemic pharmacodynamic effects or interactions unlikely.2.4.5."
"Conclusions on clinical pharmacologyThe CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology:CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 29/83The CHMP considered that, systemic side effect on blood pressure should not be ruled out and need to be further monitored even if the product is locally administered."
This measure is included in the RMP.2.5.
Clinical efficacy 2.5.1.
"Dose response study(ies)Dose-response studies in patients suffering from neovascular age-related macular degeneration:In the early development programme, IV injections of VEGF Trap (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg) were compared to placebo in Study VGTF OD 305 over an 8-week duration."
"These preliminary results suggested that the highest dose of 3.0 mg/kg provided the best improvements in visual acuity, retinal thickness and macular volume.A direct head-to-head comparison of the two formulations of VEGF Trap (ITV-1, the first formulation and ITV-2, the new formulation used in pivotal clinical studies VIEW 1 and VIEW 2) at the same dose was provided in Study VGFT-OD-0603."
The results suggested that the ITV-2 formulation (used in pivotal studies VIEW 1 and 2) would at least provide a similar effect level regarding reduction in retinal thickness or improvements in visual acuity than that observed for the VEGF Trap administered in the ITV-1 formulation (used for dose escalating studies VGFT-OD-502 and 508).
IVT route: Study VGFT-OD-0502 was the first study initiated for a clinical development of intravitreally (IVT) administered VEGF Trap in patients suffering from wet AMD.
"This was an open label, single escalating doses study (0.05 mg, 0.15 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 2.0 mg and 4.0 mg)."
"Thesmall sample size/group only allowed preliminary conclusions suggesting that better effects on visual acuity or on morphologic endpoints may be provided by higher doses (2, 4 mg) and that they may last until week 43."
"IVT route: Study VGFT-OD-0508 was a Phase-2 dose-ranging study which comprised a 12-week fixed-dosing phase followed by a flexible-dosing phase up to week 52, designed to assess the efficacy in AMD patients of repeated IVT administration of VEGF Trap at different doses and dosing intervals."
"In this study subjects who received monthly injections at the start of the study (in the 0.5 and 2 mg groups) generally had better outcomes at Week 52, supporting the proposal to administer 3 initial monthly injections of VEGF Trap prior to dosing every 8 weeks."
An initial monthly dosing up to 12 weeks was therefore chosen for the design of pivotal VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies.2.5.2.
Main study(ies) degeneration:Studies VIEW 1 and VIEW 2: in patients suffering from neovascular age-related macular This application is supported by two pivotal trials of two-year duration and of identical design.
"- Study VIEW 1 (Study VEGF-OD-605) was conducted from 02 August 2007 to 14 September 2010 (year 1 cut-off) at 154 sites in United States [US] and Canada.- Study VIEW 2 (Study A36355) was conducted at 186 sites in Asia/Pacific, Europe, and South/Latin America (first patient 11 April 2008 – 16 September 2010 (year 1 cut-off).The Study period covered from start of enrolment and last subject’s last visit was from 31 Jul 2007 to 22 Jul 2011 (VIEW 1) and to 11 Aug 2011 (VIEW 2).Both studies were multi-center, randomized, double-masked, active controlled (ranibizumab) non-inferiority designed, phase III studies."
CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 30/83The design of both studies is described below.MethodsStudy Participants The inclusion/exclusion criteria were identical in the two Phase III studies.Subjects eligible were Men and women ≥ 50 years of age had to have subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD.
"“Subfoveal” CNV was defined as the presence of subfoveal neovascularization, including juxtafoveal lesions that affect the fovea, documented through confirmed FA by an independent readingcenter."
Only one eye was designated as the study eye.
"For subjects who met eligibility criteria in both eyes, the eye with the worse visual acuity (VA) was selected as the study eye.The Main exclusion Criteria included prior ocular or systemic treatment or surgery for neovascular AMD; total lesion size >12 disc areas (30.5 mm2, including blood, scars and neovascularization); any history of ocular retinal disease history other than AMD, Any intraocular or periocular surgery within 3 months of Day 1 on the study eye, prior trabeculectomy; Previous therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye; history of corneal transplant or corneal dystrophy in the study eye; significant media opacities, including cataract; history or clinical evidence of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema or any retinal vascular disease other than AMD in either eye."
Exclusions criteria were conventional and as expected for this class of product.
Contra-indications for Lucentis as reported in the EU SPC were listed as exclusion criteria.
TreatmentsYear-1: Fixed dose/fixed schedule regimens for the first year of the studies were chosen fairly in accordance to the results from phase I and II dose-finding studies.
Subjects were randomised to one of the following regimen: 0.5Q4=0.5 mg VEGF Trap-Eye every 4 weeks; 2Q4=2 mg VEGF Trap-Eye every 4 weeks; 2Q8=2 mg VEGF Trap-Eye every 8 weeks after three initial monthly doses and compared to RQ4=ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 4 weeks.
This posology corresponds to the original dosing regimen used in the pivotal studies Marina and Anchor for ranibizumab registration either in Europe or in the US.
An aseptic procedure for IVT injection was recommended by the Applicant.
"Nevertheless, a degree of freedom was permitted to take into account the differentpractices that vary considerably among practitioners or countries.Year-2: During the second year of the study, the subjects received IVT injection of study drug or comparator at intervals determined by the specific criteria for redosing at the same dose level as originally assigned."
They were evaluated every 4 weeks.
"Injections could be given as frequently as every 4 weeks, but no less frequently than every 12 weeks (modified quarterly dosing schedule), according to the following re-dosing criteria, which were assessed by the investigator:i) Increase in CRT ≥100 μm compared to the lowest previous value (OCT), or ii) A loss of ≥5 ETDRS letters from the best previous letter score in conjunction with recurrent fluid as indicated by OCT, or iii) New or persistent fluid as indicated by OCT, or iv)New onset classic neovascularization, or v) New or persistent leak on fluorescence angiography (FA), or vi) New macular hemorrhage, or vii) 12 weeks have elapsed since the previous injection.Subjects and study personnel remained double masked with regard to the dose level but no sham injections were given in the second year for prolonged interval dosing.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 31/83Objectives were identical across both phase-3 pivotal studies: VIEW 1 and VIEW 2The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of IVT administered VEGF Trap-Eye compared to ranibizumab, in a non-inferiority design, in preventing moderate vision loss (defined as a loss < 15 letters/3 lines of vision on the ETDRS chart at a distance of 4 meters) in subjects with all subtypes ObjectivesPrimary Objectiveof neovascular AMD.Secondary Objective(s)The secondary objectives were: 1/to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated IVT administration of VEGF Trap-Eye in subjects with all sub-types of neovascular AMD for periods up to 2 years.2/to assess the effect of repeated IVT administration of VEGF Trap-Eye on Vision-Related Quality of Life (QoL) in subjects with all subtypes of neovascular AMD, as assessed using the NEI VFQ-25 questionnaire.Outcomes/endpointsPrimary EndpointVIEW 2PPS."

The comparator was supplied in commercial packaging with over labeling for local languages where necessary.Study drug injection was to be performed by an unmasked physician.
"The unmasked physician did not play any role in the study beyond the receipt, tracking, preparation, destruction and administration of study drug, as well as assessing safety at 30-60 minutes post IVT injection."
A separate masked physician was assigned to 1) assess AEs and 2) supervise the masked assessment of efficacy.
Visual acuity assessments were always masked to treatment assignment.
Statistical methodsThe predefined non-inferiority margin was set at 10% and was justified by reference to the results of pivotal studies for ranibizumab.
A conditional sequence of statistical evaluation of non-inferiority was used to control multiplicity (1) 2Q4; 2) 0.5Q4; 3) 2Q8 versus RQ4).
"A predefined test for superiority on secondary criteria was planned using again a conditional sequence of hypothesis to control multiplicity.The following methods were used for  sensitivity analyses: analysis repeated in FAS using LOCF and in FAS and PPS using Observed case analysis, Worst observed carried forward, Discontinued counted as non-responder, or Treatment failure counted as non-responder.ResultsCHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 33/83Patient disposition (all randomized subjects): Study VIEW RQ4 2Q4 0.5Q4 2Q8 VEGF Trap-Eye Combined Total Screened*FAS1PPSRandomized Treated2 (safety set)Completed Year 1 Premature discontinuation within first year Total Subject withdrawal Adverse event Deatha Lost to follow-up Protocol deviation* Treatment failure Other Completed study medicationPrematurely discontinued study medicationWithdrawal by SubjectAdverse event Lost to follow-up Death Protocol deviation*Treatment failure Other a An additional four deaths were reported during the study but not captured in the database as a reason for premature discontinuation."

"The overall mean BMI was 27.40 kg/m2, the mean weight was 75.39 kg, and the mean height was 165.60 cm."
Disease characteristics were well balanced among groups.
"Mean BVCA score was 55.1 letters; retinal thickness was 266.6 microns; area of CNV 6.6 mm2, lesion size 6.95 mm2 and NEI VQF 25 total score 70.7."
Lesion subtypes were also balanced across study groups as reported above with a predominance of occult lesions in all groups.

"It should be noted that the proportion of patients who maintained vision in the ranibizumab group was similar to that seen in VIEW 1 Study (94.4%) which is in good accordance with the results of Marina Study (by 12 months, 94.6%)."
"Numeric results for either the 2Q4 or the 2Q8 regimens were very similar (95.62 and 95.56).In contrast to VIEW 1 results, no superiority was found in VIEW 2 Study for the first step of comparison, which failed to show a statistically significant treatment difference between the 2Q4 and the RQ4 groups (p=0.076).Secondary criteria related to visual acuity:VIEW 2 - Change from Baseline to Week 52 in ETDRS Letter Score (LOCF) (FAS)RQ42Q4O.5Q42Q8 Study View 2Week 52 (change from baseline)nMean (SD)Point estimate for the contrasta95% CI for differencep-value vs RQ4ba:  Difference is VEGF Trap-Eye minus ranibizumab using LSMeans."

"In the PPS, results were consistent.Other secondary endpoints: Overall, at Week 52, in the FAS/LOCF, the results for the NEI VFQ-25 total score numerically favoured ranibizumab and when using the LSmeans from the ANCOVA main effect model, a significant difference was observed in favour of the RQ4 regimen over the 2Q4 regimen, p=0.010)."
"All baseline differences nonetheless, remained in the range (≥4-6) of clinical relevance as identified from Marina and Anchor published studies while ranibizumab provided the higher difference."
The results of the sensitivity analyses supported these results.The results for the change from Baseline to Week 52 in CNV Area numerically slightly favoured all VEGF Trap-eye regimens.
"The lowest mean decrease was observed in the RQ4 group (-4.16 mm2), the highest in the 2Q4 group (-5.95 mm2) followed by the 2Q8 (-5.16 mm2)."
"When using the LSmeans from the ANCOVA main effect model, a significant difference was observed in favour of the 2Q4 regimen over the RQ4 regimen, p=0.004)."
"The results of the sensitivity analyses (observed cases and WOCF) were consistent with the results obtained in the main analysis applying the LOCF method.In conclusion, the primary criteria analysis met the non-inferiority for all VEGF Trap-eye regimens and all secondary endpoint analyses supported the comparability of the efficacy of ranibizumab with the three VEGF Trap-Eye treatment regimens."
Sensitivity analyses in the FAS and in the PPS of primary and secondary endpoints also supported the main analyses.
"Nevertheless, results in favour of the 2Q4 regimen observed in Study VIEW 1 were not replicated in Study VIEW 2."
"In contrast to the findings observed in VIEW 1 Study, no superiority was evidenced from the first conditional ordered test hypothesis."
"In addition, while results based on visual acuity measurements seemed to rather favour the 0.5Q4 regimen, results based on morphologic endpoints seemed in favour of the 2Q4 regimen and, to a lesser extent, in favour of the 2Q8 regimen showing the greatest mean decrease in classic CNV area."
"Therefore, there were no clear tendencies of results in VIEW 2 Study to favour one dosing regimen of VEGF Trap-Eye over the others, apart the number of injections that is reduced in the 2Q8 regimen.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 38/83Since all three VEGF Trap-Eye groups were shown to be non-inferior to ranibizumab on the primary endpoint, additional comparisons were authorized with respect to secondary endpoints, and these Ancillary analyseshave been described above.Summary of main studiesThe following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present application."

"In both analysis sets, subjects were analyzed as randomized."

"The results of ancillary efficacy endpoints are supportive of the primary and secondary endpoints, showing comparable efficacy for all dosages of VEGF Trap-Eye with ranibizumab."
"Subgroup analyses showed that subjects who were younger, with poorer baseline vision and smaller lesions were more likely to maintain or gain vision."
No important differences were seen between the ranibizumab and VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q8 groups in any subgroup.
"No geographical variations were observed in VIEW 2 (conducted in Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin America)."
In no particular group did the efficacy of VEGF Trap-Eye appear to be significantly worse than expected.
"Data on certain subgroups are limited, due to the small number of patients: Black race subgroup, and history of hepatic impairment."
"However, this was not a significant concern."
Neovascular AMD has a far higher prevalence in Caucasians than Black patients and there is no reason to suggest that efficacy would differ in the two groups.
"Systemic exposure to VEGF Trap-Eye following intravitreal injection is minimal, and the liver does not play an important role in the elimination of VEGF Trap, so hepatic impairment should not affect efficacy."
Two-year pooled efficacy results (VIEW 1+VIEW 2)The applicant submitted results of Year 2 of the pivotal studies in which subjects underwent examinations every 4 weeks and were retreated with Eylea or ranibizumab according to a capped-PRN schedule.
"Injections could be given as frequently as every 4 weeks, but no less frequently than every 12 weeks."
"The retreatment criteria included an increase in CRT of ≥100 µm, a loss of ≥5 letters with recurrent fluid on OCT, new or persistent fluid, new onset classic CNV, new or persistent leak on FA, and new macular haemorrhage.Subjects disposition and analysis sets for subjects entering in year 2Of the 2457 randomized subjects, 2419 received at least 1 dose of randomized study medication in either VIEW 1 or VIEW 2."

"The most frequent primary reasons for premature discontinuation were “withdrawal by subject” (4.9% for VIEW 1 and 6.3% VIEW 2) or “adverse event” (3.1% for VIEW 1 and 4.3% for VIEW 2) showing consistently higher proportions of subjects who discontinued from the study primarily due to adverse events in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups (4.2% - 6.8%) than in the ranibizumab group CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 48/83In both studies, the treatment groups were well balanced with regard to group sizes, proportions of subjects continuing treatment in Year 2 and demographic baseline."
"Slight imbalances already present at randomization in VIEW 2 Study persist, in particular poorer baseline anatomical parameters, with greater larger total lesion and CNV areas.The dosing subgroups were determined post-hoc."
No per-protocol population was defined for the analysis of the data of Year 2.Efficacy results analysis below.
"The number of injections given in Year 2 and the time between injections are shown in the table When fixed dosing was changed to a capped-PRN schedule in Year 2, a similar mean number of injections (~4), with a similar mean interval duration between injections (~73 days), were observed for the 2Q4 and 2Q8 treatments; these appear also rather similar to ranibizumab (i.e."
4.7 injections and interval of 68 days).
"Therefore, a prolonged interval of around 10 weeks is observed for the majority of subjects in all treatment groups."
"This tends to confirm the trend observed in the dose–response study 508.Integrated analysis: Number of injections in Year 2 (Year 2 completers)R 0.5Q4VTEN=5132Q4N=5290.5Q4N=499Mean Number of Injections (SD)MedianMin-maxIntegrated analysis: Mean time between injections (Subjects entering in year 2)Mean Time between Injections, Days (SD)Median Min-maxIntegrated analysis: subjects receiving retreatment at least once in a 4-weeks interval in Year 2 (Year 2 completers)2Q4N=5710.5Q4N=5492Q8N=5112Q8N=558Integrated analysis: subjects receiving retreatment at intervals of 8 or 12-weeks in Year 2 (Year 2 completers)Integrated analysis: subjects receiving retreatment at intervals of 12-weeks in Year 2 (Year 2 completers)2Q4N=5710.5Q4N=5492Q8N=5582Q4N=5710.5Q4N=5492Q8N=5582Q4N=5710.5Q4N=5492Q8N=558N (%)N (%)N (%)0.5Q4N=5570.5Q4N=5570.5Q4N=5570.5Q4N=557311* due to one subject:  440030046Nevertheless, the VTE 2Q4 regimen shows the lower proportion of patients (29%) receiving retreatment at least once in a 4-weeks interval, and the higher (65%) receiving retreatment at intervals of 8 or 12-weeks in Year 2."
"This suggests that the 2Q4 regimen administered during the first year of treatment may yield at the end of Year 2 slightly better results than the 2Q8 regimen (36% and 58%) or the competitor ranibizumab (41.5% and 52%).A similar picture is observed from the Integrated Analysis for post hoc dosing subgroups (Year 2 study medication completers) as reported in the table below:CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 49/83Efficacy endpoint (primary endpoint for Year 1):At week 96 results show a relevant maintenance of therapeutic effect in all treatment groups, although a slight drop off in the proportion of subjects who maintained vision is observed compared to week 52."
The proportion of subjects maintaining vision was ≥90% in all treatment groups and comparable between studies.
The 95% CIs for the difference in proportions between the VEGF Trap-Eye group and the RQ4 group were consistently well below the boundary of 10%.
Results show the same trend when the LOCF method was repeated with the observed values only.

"The higher proportion of subjects was observed in the 2Q8 group for gain ≥ 30 letters (7.3%) or ≥ 15 letters (33.4%)  (LOCF, FAS)."
"The proportion of subjects with vision loss ≥ 5 letters or ≥ 30 letters were approximately 16-18% or 2.3-3.3% with the highest proportion in the 2Q8 group (3.3%) (LOCF, FAS)."
"2/Change from Baseline in central retinal thickness (FAS, LOCF):At Week 52, the results of the pairwise comparisons were all numerically in favour of the VEGF Trap-Eye treatment."
"By Week 96, the absolute reduction in CRT from Baseline was also most pronounced in the 2Q8 groups (-121 ± 116 μm) compared to the RQ4 group (114 ± 110 μm) in VIEW 1 study and in the 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups (-146 ± 128 μm and 145 ± 118 μm, respectively) compared to the RQ4 group was -121 ± 130 μm."
A similar trend was observed in VIEW 2.Therefore the one year reductions were not completely maintained in all groups over the whole 2-year treatment period.
"The largest increase in CRT from Week 52 to Week 96/100 was seen under RQ4 treatment (18.3 ± 76.0 μm) while the mean increase in the combined VEGF Trap-Eye 2 mg groups (2Q4 and 2Q8) was 8.2 ± 63.0 μm.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 51/833/Proportion of subjects without intraretinal cystic edema and/or subretinal fluid (dry retina) on In both studies, the proportions of subjects with retinal fluid increased between W52 and W96/100 by about 15-20% or 15% in VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies, respectively, showing that, overall, the proportion of subjects with dry retinal fluid status declined from Week 52 to Week 96."
At Week 96 retinal fluid remains present in approximately 40-50% of the subjects.
"Integrated Analysis: Proportion of subjects with dry retinal fluid status on OCT (W52 and 96 – OV OCT:FAS)At W52: 2Q4, 72%; 2Q8, 68% vs RQ4, 62% At W96/100:  2Q4, 54%; 2Q8, 50% vs RQ4, 45% These results may suggest that the disease is progressing more during year 2."
"Since no fixed regimen was included as comparator arm for treatments through year 2, the link with the change in the schedule of administration (capped-PRN regimen applied in the second year) is not demonstrated.4/Proportion of subjects receiving re-treatment within the first 12 weeks of the second year (at Weeks 52 or 56 - subjects entering Year 2) of the studyThe proportion of subjects receiving their first re-treatment injections prior to the mandatory dose after 12 weeks in Year 2 was approximately 10% higher in the RQ4 and 0.5Q4 groups than in the VEGF Trap-Eye 2 mg groups (approximately 40% versus approximately 30%), reinforcing the choice of the 2 mg VTE dosing."
"Post hoc dosing subgroup analysis (observed values; Year 2 study completers)Additional analyses were performed on post-hoc determined dosing subgroups in the group of Year 2 study medication completers with regard to BCVA (changes in ETDRS letter score) and OCT data (changes in CRT and retinal fluid status): i) Subjects with ≤ 3 injections in Year 2; ii) Subjects with 4-6 injections in Year 2; iii) Subjects with ≥ 7 injections in Year 2; iv) Subjects with re-treatment always in the interval of 8 or 12 weeks in Year 2 (this subgroups was considered only in the integrated analysis).In these dosing subgroups, as observed in the whole population, increases in BCVA from baseline to W96/100 are still observed ranging from 5.5 (2Q4; ≥7 injections) to 10.3 letters (RQ4; 4-6 injections)."
"Although no meaningful differences between groups were identified, numeric BCVA values suggest that subjects receiving ≤ 3 injections or re-treatment every 8 or 12 weeks, in Year 2, may undergo meaningful improvements in vision with less re-treatments than the other dosing groups."
"The percentage of patients receiving re-treatment every 8 or 12 weeks in Year 2 was > Vision gain and loss show a similar picture with more than 70% of patients gaining ≥ 0 letters, approximately 35-60% of patients gaining ≥ 10 letters and 25-40% of patients gaining ≥ 15 letters."
"Overall, visual gains seem to numerically favoured the 2Q8 regimen (year 1), except for the dosing group 4-6 injections that show numeric gains favouring RQ4 (83%, 60%, 38 %) vs the VEGF trap eye regimens (<76%; 51%; 35%)."
"Less than 9% of subjects underwent vision gain ≥ 30 letters (except for 2Q8, ≥7 injections that reached 15%)."
"Less than 4% of subjects underwentvision loss ≥ 30 letters in all groups.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 52/83Changes in CRT: in all treatment groups, subjects who received ≤ 3 injections in Year 2 and subjects who received re-treatment every 8 or 12 weeks in Year 2 had the largest decreases in mean CRT during the study (130-151 microns and 124-147microns, respectively)."
"In both dosing subgroups, the highest decreases in CRT were observed in the 2Q8 treatment groups."
Changes in retinal fluid status: new or persistent fluid as indicated by OCT was the most frequent reason for retreatment (i.e.
in approximately 50% of cases).
"Similarly to what observed for CRT changes, the subgroups of subjects who received ≤ 3 injections in Year 2 and those who received re-treatment always every 8 or 12 weeks in Year 2 also included the highest proportions of subjects without detectable retinal fluid.Results on dosing subgroups are not surprising since these results may also reflect a more aggressive progression of the disease for these patients who need more frequent re-treatments, independently of the effect of the drug."
"Therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution."
Clinical studies in special populationsNo special populations were formally studied.
"In the two pivotal studies and the integratedanalysis, a number of subgroups were considered for efficacy and safety analyses based ondemographics (eg, age, sex, race ..) and baseline disease characteristics (eg, visual acuity, lesiontype, lesion size).The only prognostic factor identified for maintaining vision was “age”.Differences between subgroups were not subjected to formal statistical testing."
"Overall, no clear tendency was identified among these analyses and no consistent pattern of clinically relevantdifferences compared to the analyses of the overall population was observed."
Supportive study(ies)No formal supportive studies were performed.
2.5.3.
Discussion on clinical efficacyDesign and conduct of clinical studiesThe design and the conduct of clinical studies submitted for Eylea were in line with the requirement of the scientific advices which were sought by the Applicant and the historical development of previous AMD treatments.
A non-inferiority design with respect to prevention of moderate vision loss (loss < 15 letters of vision on ETDRS chart compared to baseline) versus monthly IVT injection of ranibizumab (Lucentis) was considered appropriate.
The primary criterion selected allowed comparing identical study endpoints for VEGF Trap-Eye and ranibizumab since a similar criterion was used in both pivotal trials conducted with ranibizumab for European and US registrations (i.e.
Marina and Anchor studies).
"In addition, this permitted also to compare data to the two other drugs registered in Europe (Macugen and Visudyne) to treat wet AMD."
"This criterion was also, according to the two pivotal placebo-controlled trials BPD OCR 002 A and B, the historical endpoint which was used for the first medication registered in Europe and the US to treat neovascular AMD (i.e."
PDT with verteporfin (Visudyne).
"However, this historical endpoint is based on a large vision loss (<15 letters) which doesn’t anymore reflect the current expectations of practitioners."
"From a practitioners’ view, a more stringent primary outcome would be the mean change from baseline in visual acuity at 1 year, with a suitable non-inferiority margin chosen and justified by the applicant."
"CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 53/83Therefore, importantly, the Applicant integrated as first secondary criteria, the “Mean change from baseline in BCVA” as measured by ETDRS letter score, at Week 52."
This criterion was used also as a basis for the first conditional ordered superiority analyses.
"The second important secondary criteria was the “proportion of subjects who gained ≥ 15 letters of vision” from baseline, at Week 52."
"Otherwise, “gain ≥ 30 letters or degradation ≥ 30 letters” in visual acuity were additional endpoints of importance.The complete panel of examinations related to visual acuity or to the morphologic aspect of CNV lesions explored correlates well with the current clinical practice and the procedures used were relevant."
The ETDRS procedure is a reliable method for BCVA measurement since it is well standardized (e.g.
"room lightening, optotype distance (4 meters)…) and was used in previous studies."
In addition to the gold standard -fluorescein angiography examination- optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a standard practice of eye specialists to follow the progression of wet AMD and adapt the management of patients’ care in case of retinal diseases.The investigated population and the control treatment in the pivotal studies VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 were appropriate as well as the large number of patients exposed and the endpoints explored.
All deficiencies concerning the protocol or the choice or the management of statistics as identified during the early review of the one year results have been clarified and resolved by the Applicant.
"In the pivotal studies, the statistical methods used an acceptable ordered sequence of conditional tests."
"While the use of a non-inferiority design was appropriate, the chosen non-inferiority margin of 10% could have been considered too wide: however the final results were reassuring in showingobserved non inferiority margins well below 10%."
"The baseline characteristics of subjects in VIEW 2 suggested a slightly more severe disease at the beginning of the study than those in VIEW 1, which was accepted since the severity of disease in participants of both studies falls within the expected clinical scope of untreated AMD."
"This disparity between VIEW 1 and 2 was attributed by the MAA partly to differences in the methodology used for interpretation of the OCT images by the central reading centres in the assessment of CRT on OCT (readers used in VIEW 1 study a center-point thickness measurement while in VIEW 2, they used a central subfield approach)."
"These appeared to have affected the results, but a reanalysis of VIEW 1 data by the applicant using the methodology utilised in VIEW 2 showed that the results were comparable when analysed with the same methodology."
"Both studies demonstrated non-inferiority of Eylea 2Q8 versus ranibizumab, and it was accepted that differences in the baseline characteristics of subjects in the two studies did not preclude an integrated analysis of the results.Efficacy data and additional analysesOne year results:One year results from both pivotal studies supported a clinically relevant non-inferiority of all dosages and regimens of VEGF Trap-Eye over ranibizumab, administered monthly."
The results were convincing in terms of preservation of visual acuity.
Both trials were successful with regard to the primary endpoint using a non-inferiority margin of either 10% or 7%.
"95-96% of subjects who received 2 mg VEGF Trap-Eye every 8 weeks maintained vision at Week 52, as compared to 94% of subjects who received ranibizumab."
"The applicant provided a short discussion about the variability of results for the primary endpoint across the two pivotal studies, particularly when the most conservative analysis was considered (with all drop-outs counted as non-responders using the full analysis set) and has clarified that inconsistencies observed in the results of the sensitivity analysis in the FAS, counting drop-outs as non-responders, especially in the comparison of the 2Q4 dosing regimen of VEGF and ranibizumab, CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 54/83are explained by the different drop-out rates of the 2Q4 VEGF Trap-Eye groups and ranibizumab groups between the studies."
"This was accepted by CHMP.The clinically relevant result for the primary endpoint was backed up by secondary endpoints, which showed that subjects receiving VEGF Trap-Eye gained an average of 8-9 letters at Week 52, with 30-31% of subjects gaining at least 3 lines of vision."
These results were comparable to those for subjects in the active comparator group who received ranibizumab.
"Visual function questionnaire test scores improved by 5 points for those on VEGF Trap-Eye, and CNV area was reduced by 3-5 mm2, again comparable to ranibizumab."
"The results of ancillary efficacy endpoints were generally supportive of the primary and secondary endpoints, showing comparable efficacy for VEGF Trap-Eye 2Q8, 2Q4 and 0.5Q4 with ranibizumab."
The distribution of subjects with varying levels of vision loss and gain were comparable across groups and studies.
In the VIEW studies a slightly greater proportion of Eylea 2Q8 subjects experienced a loss of vision from baseline in the first year than those treated with ranibizumab.
"However, this difference seemed to disappear in Year 2, when PRN treatment was initiated."
"The difference seen in Year 1 was small (around 4 percentage points at most), and was not considered relevant."
"Two year results:Since neovascular AMD is a chronic disease which requires ongoing treatment, the Year 1 results needed to be confirmed at two years."
"The proportion of subjects maintaining vision were ≥ 90% in all treatment groups and was comparable between individual studies, although a slight drop off in the proportion of subjects who maintained vision was observed compared to week 52."
Decreases (by 1-2 letters) in mean ETDRS letter score occurred in the second year with a similar picture in all treatment groups.
"Also, a slight decrease occurred in the second year in the proportion of patients who gained ≥ 15 letters."
"Discussion on the number of injections received by patients during year two:According to the integrated analysis of Year 2 completers, the mean number of injections was approximately similar in all treatments groups (around 4, range: 4.7 for RQ4 vs 4.1-4.2 for 2Q4 or 2Q8) with an interval of around 70 days (range: 67.9 for RQ4 vs 73.7-73.2 for 2Q4 or 2Q8), also approximately similar between groups."
About a third of subjects received at least one injection in Year 2 at an interval of one month from the previous injection.
"Of these, most patients received ≤ 6 injections while “4-week interval” was only an isolated event for these patients."
"Nevertheless, it could not be ruled out that a monthly regimen may help to stabilize vision in some patients in the long term."
"To elucidate this point, the CHMP requested that the applicant commit to a post authorisation study.2.5.4."
"Conclusions on the clinical efficacyThe efficacy of Eylea 2 mg in the treatment of wet AMD was demonstrated over the two years data.The primary endpoint analysis met the non-inferiority margins for all VEGF Trap-eye regimens, and all secondary endpoint analyses support the comparability of the efficacy of ranibizumab with the three VEGF Trap-Eye treatment schedules."
"According to study VIEW 1 results, the 2Q4 regimen showed the best results in term of vision, with superior gain in the number of letters read at Week 52; retinal morphology evolution showed also better results with the 2Q4 regimen than with the other regimens."
"In the VIEW 2 study however, the 52-week numeric results favoured the 0.5Q4 regimen while the 2Q4 and 2Q8 regimens were CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 55/83very similar and still non inferior to ranibizumab."
"Wile this result confirmed the efficacy of Eylea in the proposed indication, it left a degree of uncertainty in the selection of the mostappropriate dosage regimen."
This was also shown by the year 2 data: the possibility of visual improvements with less than 3 injections by year is not excluded.
"Some patients did require occasional injections on a monthly basis in Year 2, but it is not clear in which circumstances this would be beneficial."
"As there were no clear tendencies of results to favour one dosing regimen of VEGF Trap-Eye over the others, the 2Q8 regimen was chosen as it reduces the number of injections.outcomes."
"Therefore the CHMP concluded that for the long term (after the first 12 months of treatment), patients should continue to be treated with Eylea every 2 months and that after the first 12 months of treatment with Eylea, the treatment interval could be extended based on visual and anatomic The CHMP also considered that there are still uncertainties regarding the choice of dosing schedule, as it was not demonstrated whether a proactive or a reactive approach was the most beneficial."
The SmPC reflects the fact that there is no requirement for monitoring between injections and there is the possibility for the patients to receive monthly injections based on clinician evaluation.
The Applicant also committed to submit a clinical study aimed to compare the proactive regimen with injection every 2 months with a reactive regimen based on visual and anatomic outcomes.
"The approved indication reads as follows:The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg aflibercept, equivalent to 50 microlitres.Eylea treatment is initiated with one injection per month for three consecutive doses, followed by one injection every two months."
There is no requirement for monitoring between injections.
"After the first 12 months of treatment with Eylea, the treatment interval may be extended based on visual and anatomic outcomes."
"In this case the schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating physician and may be more frequent than the schedule of injections.The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:To perform a post-authorisation randomised study with the primary objective of comparing the standard regime of injections every 8 weeks with a reactive regimen based on visual and anatomic outcomes, based on a CHMP approved protocol.The final clinical study report should be submitted by December 31, 2017.The protocol will be submitted for CHMP agreement by Q1, 2013.The clinical safety analysis was based on data pooled from two phase 3 studies (VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 constituting pool 1) and phase 1/2 studies (pool 2)."
"Overall, 11 ophthalmology studies were integrated in the safety analysis, including 7 studies in the requested indication of AMD; 3 of these studies are completed (phase 1 and 2) and 4 are still on-going (2 pivotal and 2 extension studies)."

"During the first year of treatment in the pool 1 studies, plannedexposure to VEGF Trap-Eye in the study eye was 2 mg administered monthly (13 IVT injections,26 mg/yr) or every 2 months (8 IVT injections, 16 mg/yr), or 0.5 mg administered monthly(13 IVT injections, 6.5 mg/yr),  and planned exposure to ranibizumab was 0.5 mgadministered monthly (13 IVT injections, 6.5 mg/yr)."
"The mean number of injectionsadministered was similar among the monthly dosing regimens (12.3 in the RQ4, 12.3 in the 2Q4,and 12.2 in the 0.5Q4 groups) and just over half of that in the 2Q8 treatment group (7.5)."

"ECG and Potential nasomucosal side effects were investigated in a sub-set of subjects participating in the ENT sub-study in VIEW 2 trial only.Overall, when safety results are pooled from the 2 pivotal studies, the rate of ocular and non-ocular TEAEs appears to be similar between VEGF Trap-Eye and comparator groups.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 57/83Overall Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Pool 1 (SafetyAnalysis Set)R 0.5 mg Q4N=595 (100%)VTE 2.0 mg Q4N=613 (100%)VTE 0.5 mg Q4N=601 (100%)VTE 2.0 mg Q8N=610 (100%)VTE totalN=1824 (100%)TOTALN=2419 (100%)Number (%) of subjects with:Any TEAEAny non-ocular TEAEAny study drug relatedTEAEAny injection relatedTEAEMaximum intensity for any  non-ocular TEAEMildModerateSevereMaximum intensity for any ocular TEAE (study eye)MildModerateSevereMaximum intensity for any ocular TEAE (fellow eye)MildModerateSevereAny ocular TEAE(study eye)Any study drug relatedTEAEAny injection relatedTEAEAny ocular TEAE(Fellow Eye)Any study drug relatedTEAEAny injection relatedTEAEAny TEAE leading to death [1,2]Any TE SAEAny non-ocular TE SAE Any ocular TE SAE (StudyEye)Any ocular TE SAE(Fellow Eye)Any TEAE causing disc.of study drugAny TEAE causing Disc."

All events reported byat least 5% of subjects are displayed.TEAEs reported in the supportive phase 1 and phase 2 studies were consistent with those seen inthe pivotal phase 3 studies.
"The most common ocular TEAEs occurring  in  the  study  eye  for the  pool  2 (non pivotal studies) any  dose  group  were  conjunctival  haemorrhage (47 subjects; 23.2%), reduced VA (31 subjects; 15.3%), and increased IOP (26 subjects; 12.8%).The 4 combined PRN group had a higher incidence than the other doses for eye pain, foreign body sensation in eyes, and lacrimation increased."

"All events reported by at least 5% ofsubjects are displayed.In Pool 1, the number of ocular drug-related TEAEs was rather low (5.5% in total) and similar between treatment groups (6.6% ranibizumab vs 5.2% VTE)."
"The most common drug-related TEAEs were vitreous floaters, visual acuity reduced and IOP increased with maximum of 1.2% of CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 59/83rate."
The majority of cases were sporadic with a rate < 1%.
"Of note, macular degeneration was observed in 11 (0.5%) patients in VEGF Trap-eye group compared to no case in ranibizumab In pool 2, only 14 subjects reported drug-related ocular treatment-emergent AEs (6.9%) including 3% of IOP increased.Non-ocular Treatment-Emergent Adverse EventsIn Pool 1, 71.8% of subjects overall reported non-ocular TEAEs; the frequency of which was similar among treatment groups: (69.7% [ RQ4], 73.4% [2Q4], 72.7% [O.5Q4], and 71.5% group."
"[2Q8].The most common non-ocular TEAEs in pool 1 were nasopharyngitis (7.8% overall), hypertension(6.8% overall) headache (4.2% overall), bronchitis (3.9% overall), and urinary tract infection (3.6% overall])."
"Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred with similar frequency across alltreatment groups, and were generally characteristic of patients in the age range studied.Non-ocular TEAEs reported in pool 2 were consistent with those seen in pool 1."
"The  most common  non-ocular  TEAEs  observed  in  subjects  in  pool 2  were  nasopharyngitis (14subjects; 6.9%), urinary tract infection (13 subjects; 6.4%), bronchitis (11 subjects; 5.4%), and hypertension (10 subjects; 4.9%).Cardiovascular Events: (a) Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs): the incidence of APTC ATEs was similar in the pivotal studies: 1.7% in ranibizumab group vs 1.8 in VEGF Trap-eye groups."
"In the long-term safety study (VGFT-OD-0702), 13 patients (8.3%) reported arterial thromboembolic events."
"Arterial thromboembolic events, as defined by ApTC criteria, include nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or vascular death including deaths of unknown cause).When TEAEs are analysed as TEAEs of interest in pool 1 (SOC and PT), the global rate of arterial thromboembolic events (refer to table 69 of Summary of Clinical Safety), was higher in VEGF Trap-eye groups (3.2%) when compared to the ranibizumab (1.8%) group."
The CHMP listed arterialthromboembolic events as an important potential risk in the RMP and covered in section 4.8 of the SmPC.
(b) Hypertension.
"In pool 1, hypertension was frequently reported non-ocular TEAE, observed in 7.9% of patients in ranibizumab group and 6.5% in VEGF Trap-eye groups."
"In addition, hypertension has been reported in 23 (14.6%) patients in pool 2.Taking into account the potential role of VEGF in the systemic cardiovascular events and the fact that almost 20% of drug substance goes through the systemic circulation, systemic effects of VEGFTrap-eye cannot be excluded.2-Year DataA similar number of subjects with any study drug-related adverse event, with any injection-related AE and any AE of interest has been reported in the study groups."
"However, more subjects discontinued the study due to adverse event in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups (2Q4 4.2%, 0.5Q4 6.5%, 2Q8 4.9%) compared to ranibizumab (3.5%)."
"These AEs were in majority mild and moderate with however about 20% of severe AEs (21.7% in ranibizumab, 20.3% in VEGF Trap-Eye groups).CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 60/83With regards to ocular AEs, a similar number of events has been reported between the study groups."
"Conjunctival haemorrhage, retinal haemorrhage, visual acuity reduced and eye pain were very frequently reported in all groups."
"There were some slight differences between the recommended dose group (2Q8) and the comparator ranibizumab group in the rate of retinal CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 61/83haemorrhage (16.2% vs 14.3%), visual acuity reduced (13% vs 11.3%) and eye pain (8.9% vs Few of ocular AEs were considered as related to study treatment, 7.4% in ranibizumab group vs 6.7% in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups and the differences in the percentage are not significant.The incidence of injection-related TEAEs was significantly higher in VIEW 1 when compared to VIEW 2 study."
The applicant explained that this was due to the mode of peri-procedural anaesthesia that was different between the two studies.Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant eventsSevere ocular TEAEsPool 1: the number of severe ocular TEAEs is low and similar between the treated groups.
"However, more eye disorders were reported in VEGF Trap-eye groups (3%) compared to ranibizumab group (2%).Endophtalmitis was reported in 0.5% of patients in ranibizumab and 2Q4 group, as well as IOP increased, retinal haemorrhage and conjunctival haemorrhage."
Three cases of cataract were reported in VEGF Trap-eye groups and none in ranibizumab group.
"Severe eye pain occurred more frequently in VEGF treated groups (0.5%) compared to comparator group (0.3%).Pool 2: Only 2 subjects reported severe ocular TEAEs in the study eye:  in study VGFT-OD-0508,1 subject in the 0.5 PRN group had severe uveitis and 1 subject in the combined 4 PRN grouphad severe retinal vascular disorder.Severe non-ocular TEAEsPool 1: 204 (8.4%) subjects experienced severe non-ocular TEAEs:  50 (8.4%) subjects in the RQ4 group, 40 (6.5%) subjects in the 2Q4 group, 59 (9.8%) subjects in the 0.5Q4 group, and 55 (9.0%) subjects in the 2Q8 group."
"The percentage of subjects in each treatment group reportingsevere non-ocular TEAEs was similar across the treatment groups.The most common severe non-ocular TEAEs was myocardialinfarction, and this occurred in 0.5% (12/2419) of subjects, overall."
All other severe non-ocular TEAEs occurred in 0.3% of subjects.One case of transient ischemic attack (TIA) was considered to be related to study drug in the 2Q4 group.
"In total, TIA was observed in 10 patients treated with VEGF Trap-eye while no cases occurred in comparator group."
Pool 2: severe n o n -ocular T E A E s w e r e reported  in  7.4%  (15)  of  subjects.The most commonly reported severe non-ocular TEAE was congestive cardiac failure (in 2 subjects; 1%).
All other severe non-ocular TEAEs occurred in only 1 subject each.Deaths.
"A total of 26 subjects died in Pool 1 during year 1 (7 subjects in the RQ4 group, 5subjects in the 2Q4 group, 4 subjects in the 0.5Q4 group, and 10 subjects in the 2Q8 group)(cut-off date of 10 November 2010)."
"None of the deaths was considered related to study drug.The reported causes of death were consistent with what would be expected in the elderlypopulation with AMD: cardiac disorders (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, cardiopulmonary failure), neoplasm (hepatic neoplasm malignant, leukaemia, lung cancer), cerebral haemorrhage.Most cases of death occurred in the 2Q8 group (10)."
Slightly more deaths have been reported in 2Q8 group (1.5%) when compared to 2Q4 (0.7%) and 0.5Q4 (0.5%) groups during the CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 62/83development programme.
"As cause of death, 2 cases of vascular disorders were observed in 2Q8 group, and none in other groups.A total of 2 subjects died in Pool 2."
One subject (in the 4 combined PRN group) with a pre-existing condition of pulmonary hypertension died 85 days after the last dose of study drug dueto cardiac arrest.
The other subject (in the 2PRN group) died due to pancreatic   carcinoma  diagnosed   112 d a y s    after  receiving  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.Long-term study (VGFT-OD-0702): 8 subjects died during the period from baseline of thisstudy to the cut-off date.
"Two of the deaths occurred after the subjects had completed the initialstudy but before they had received  study  treatment  in  the  long-term  safety  study.A total of 3 deaths were reported during the first 6 months of VGFT-OD-0706, 1 subject each in the   0.5Q4  (multi-organ failure), 2Q4 (sudden death), and 2Q8 (convulsion) groups."
None of theevents that led to  death in these subjects were judged  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to study  drug.2-Year DataDeaths.
"Full 2-year data showed a total of 68 deaths (2.8%) reported in the 2 studies, including 20 deaths (3.3%) in 2Q8, 19 (3.2%), 13 (2.1%) and 16 (2.7%) in ranibizumab group."
The trend in difference in number of deaths was not confirmed during the second year of treatment.
"Also, the total number in Eylea groups is comparable with the ranibizumab group.Ocular serious TEAEs."
"In the integrated analysis, 91 study subjects (3.8%) were documented to have ocular SAEs in the study eye by the end of Year 2."
"As seen in the single studies, many of these events were likely procedure-related or AMD-related, with ""visual acuity reduced"" (19 study pool subjects [0.8%]), ""retinal hemorrhage"" (17 study pool subjects [0.7%])), and ""cataract"" (12 study pool subjects [0.5%]) being the prevailing events.Five cases of endophtalmitis, including one case of pseudoendophtalmitis have been reported, 4 in VIEW 1 and one in VIEW 2 study."
Two cases have been observed in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups (0.5Q4 and 2Q4) and 3 cases in ranibizumab group.
All cases of endophtalmitis were considered related to the study drug procedure.
This event is covered in sections 4.4. and 4.8. of the SmPC and is mentioned as an important identified risk in the RMP.Non-ocular serious TEAEs.
"Non-ocular, drug-related treatment-emergent SAEs occurred at a higher frequency in Eylea-treated subjects, though the absolute numbers were low; 7 cerebrovascular events (0.8%) in Eylea-treated subjects (mostly in VIEW 2), none in ranibizumab-treated subjects."
"Furthermore, a higher frequency of TIAs was detected in Eylea-treated subjects in VIEW 1 than for ranibizumab: 18 events (2%) versus 1 (0.3%)."
"This trend was not observed in VIEW 2, nor is a trend observed when arterial thromboembolic events are analysed according to the APTC criteria."
Laboratory findingsChemistryThe incidences of pre-defined laboratory abnormalities were low and balanced among treatment groups for all clinical chemistry test parameters.Hypercholesterolaemia was reported as a TEAE in 34 (1.4%) subjects in pool 1 during the first year of the studies (RQ4 1.3%; 2Q4 1.0%; 0.5Q4 1.5%; 2Q8 1.8%) and in 51 (2.1%) subjects in the 2nd year of treatment (RQ4 2.2%; 2Q4 1.5%; 0.5Q4 2.0%; 2Q8 2.8%).
The occurrence ofhypercholesterolemia is expected in this elderly population and its rate remains low.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 63/83No safety signal emerged from haematology and vital signs data.
"The majority of the treated subjects (1371 and 131 subjects, respectively), had a medical history of hypertension."
"Blood pressure changes were presented as the mean and median values, showing no apparent trend over time in pool 1 and 2."
No increases in SBP and DBP have been observed in the sub-group of patients with medical history of hypertension up to 2 years of treatment.
"However, according to the results of the PK studies, there is a possibility that aflibercept might increase blood pressure."
"As part of the pharmacovigilance activities, it is requested that the post-marketing andstudy reports which indicate hypertension should be followed up with a targeted questionnaire.Safety in special populationsIntrinsic FactorsSubgroup analyses were conducted on the following safety variables  for subjects  in pool 1: gender; age (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years to < 75 years, ≥ 75 years); race (white, black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, orother); ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino [no / yes]); renal status (CLCR > 80 mL/min [normal], > 50— 80 mL/min [mild impairment], > 30 - 50 mL/min [moderate impairment], 2 30 mL/min orrequiring  dialysis  [severe  impairment]),  history of diabetes  mellitus,  cataracts,  hypertension, CVA/stroke, and myocardial infarction.The number  of subjects  in the  following  subgroups  within  pool 1 were  too small to  allow meaningful comparisons: race     (other);  renal        impairment  (severe  impairment); hepatic impairment, and  proteinuria;  although  there  were  few  subjects  in  the  subgroup  of CVA/stroke, analyseswere conducted as this is an adverse event of interest.Overall, the results of the subgroup analyses of all TEAEs were similar to those seen in the entire study population."
"No clinically relevant imbalances or trends were seen among the treatment groups.Extrinsic FactorsPre-filled syringes vs. VialsAlthough there where differences in the incidence of events comparing  the  vial  to  the  PFS group, they appeared random and a pattern was not discerned between the 2 groups."
"Pregnancy, Lactation and FertilityAflibercept produced embryo-foetal toxicity in rabbit and effects on male and female fertility in monkey after intravenous administration."
"However, there are large safety margins when compared to corresponding values observed in humans after an intravitreal therapeutic dose."
"Therefore, systemic effects are unlikely in patients, including pregnant women."
"In addition, exposure of a woman of childbearing potential to Aflibercept seems to be unlikely given the indication.It is noted that products of the same therapeutic class are already marketed (Lucentis® and Macugen®), whose SmPCs indicate they should not be used during pregnancy unless there is a clear benefit."
"Similar recommendations regarding pregnancy, fertility and lactation were inserted in the Product Information.OverdoseIn clinical studies with VEGF Trap-Eye, isolated cases of overdose of up to 10-fold were generally well tolerated."
"One subject received a single dose of 20 mg VGFT Trap-Eye in 500 μLCHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 64/83volume (instead of the planned 2 mg in 50 μL), which was associated with increased injection volume and subsequently with a transient increase in IOP lasting 1 day."
No other TEAE wereobserved.
"As of January 2011, all overdosed subjects recovered without sequelae.The  concentration  of  bound  VEGF Trap  in  plasma  following  IVT  administration  of  up  to 4mg/eye was about 20-fold lower than those following IV administration of 1 to 4 mg/kg."
"Since IVadministration of VEGF Trap at doses ≥1 mg/kg every 2 weeks was required to completely saturate  endogenous  VEGF  synthesized  over  the  dosing  interval,  the  IVT  doses  being investigated in this development programme did not appear to be able to saturate systemic VEGF."
This conclusion is supported by the observation that the peak concentration of bound VEGF Trap continued to increase in a dose-dependent manner with increasing IVT doses.Recommended treatment: overdoses of up to 20 mg/eye were generally well tolerated.
Overdosing was associated with increased injection volume and subsequently with increased IOP.
"Therefore, when overdose is associated with  increased  volume,  IOP  should  be  monitored  and if deemed  necessary  by the  treating physician, adequate treatment should be initiated.Drug AbuseVEGF Trap-Eye will be administered by a qualified physician."
"The drug will not be prescribed for s e l f -administration In addition, the method of VEGF Trap-Eye administration, IVT injection, isnot conductive to drug abuse.There has been no evidence of psychotropic properties associated with the study drug."
"Post-intraocular-injection, VEGF-Trap binds with VEGF-A to form a complex."
"As a protein molecule,VEGF-Trap and its complex are too large to cross the blood-brain barrier, which limits anypossibility for centrally-mediated effects associated with drug abuse.Withdrawal and ReboundAge-related macular degeneration requires lifelong treatment."
"Cessation of treatment with VEGFTrap-Eye does not mean that the disease will not recur; VA may again decline over time,consistent with the disease process."
"There is a large variability in patient presentation, course oftreatment, and need for re-treatment in cases of wet AMD.Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental AbilityVEGF Trap-Eye is an ophthalmologic preparation intended to treat visually impaired patients."
Subjects may experience temporary visual disturbances after an IVT injection with VEGF Trap- Eyeand the associated eye examinations.
"As a result, they should not drive or use machinery untilvisual function has sufficiently recovered.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 65/83Elderly populationTable  3:  Number  of  subjects  with  non-ocular  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  in  the  elderly  population grouped by age (Year 1 data) - AmendedAge Group 65 years 65 –  75 years 75 –  85 years 85 yearsRanibizumabN=71 (100%)VEGF Trap-Eye (Total)N=202 RanibizumabN=163 VEGF Trap-Eye (Total)N=478 Ranibizumab(N=274 VEGF Trap-Eye (Total)N=861 RanibizumabN=87 VEGF Trap-Eye (Total)N=283 (100%)AE related to fallingCardiovascular eventsCerebrovascular eventsInfections and Infestations 23 (32.4%)Any non-ocular TEAEsFatal (ie, deaths)SeriousWithdrawals or discontinuationsAny non-ocular TEAEs by AE groupingCNS (confusion/extrapyramidal)Several tables on number of subjects with TEAEs, ocular TEAEs and non-ocular TEAEs in the elderly population grouped by age and including year 1 and 2-year data have been provided by the applicant."
No deaths related to ocular TEAEs have been reported in the elderly during 2 years.
The rate of deaths from non-ocular TEAEs was comparable between the treatment groups during the first and the second year of treatment and increased with age.
"Ocular TEAEs were related to the infections; in addition, 3 cases of blepharospasm have been observed in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 66/83The number of cerebrovascular events was higher in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups (35) compared with ranibizumab (2 cases) in elderly, especially in the sub-group ≥ 85 years (20 vs 1 case), during the first year of treatment."
Two-year data showed also the increased number of cerebrovascular events in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups vs ranibizumab: 53 vs 12 (27 vs 3 in the sub-group ≥ 85 years).
"One death due to CVA in the 0.5Q4 group and one death due to ischemic stroke in the 2Q8 group were considered as treatment related.Immunological eventsAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential to develop immunogenicity towards VEGF Trap-Eye, and this is mentioned in section 4.4 of the SmPC."
"In  order  to  monitor  subjects  for the  potential  appearance of  anti-VEGF Trap antibodies,  serum  samples  were  collected  at study-specific  time  points  during  each  of  the VEGF Trap   clinical studies and examined for the presence of ADA (Anti-drug antibodies).The resulting immunogenicity data  reflects  the  percentage  of  subjects  whose  test  results were  considered positive for ADA in immunoassays and are highly dependent on the sensitivityand specificity of the assays."
"Early studies (pool 2) used a validated, direct ADA enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assess immunogenicity; no samples from these studies wereconfirmed positive for ADA."
"For the phase 3 studies (VIEW 1 and 2), a validated, titer-based, bridging ADA immunoassay, which is approximately 40-fold more sensitive than the original ADA ELISA, was used to assess immunogenicity."
In these phase 3 studies the pre-treatmentincidence of immunoreactivity to VEGF Trap-Eye was 1% to 3% across treatment groups.
"Afterdosing with VEGF Trap-Eye for 52 weeks, treatment-emergent positive responses in the assaywere detected in a similar percentage range of subjects across treatment groups.The observed low level of positive assay responses in subjects treated with ranibizumab wassimilar to the levels  in subjects treated with VEGF Trap-Eye, suggesting that a majority ofthese positive assay responses may be due to pre-existing immunoreactivity in these subjects and, therefore, not due to an immune response to VEGF Trap-Eye.The tables on proportion of subjects with maintained vision at week 52 and week 96 by negative or positive ADA results have been provided."
These 2-year data showed that the majority of subjects with positive ADA results maintained their vision.
"However, the analysis was based on the small number of subjects having positive ADA, especially during the first year of treatment (41 subjects in VIEW 1 and 38 in VIEW 2)."
"At week 96, 86 subjects had positive ADA and the majority maintained the vision status (87% to 100%).Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactionsNo formal drug interaction studies have been performed with VEGF-Trap Eye.Individuals with AMD are generally older and often have concomitant diseases that are characteristic of an older population."
"Study subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye clinical developmentprogramme had  a  mean  age  of  76.0  years  and  a  medical  history  characteristic  of individuals   in  the  target   AMD  population.The mean age of  the population in the VEGFTrap-Eye clinical development programme is similar to that found in the MARINA study range= 52 — 95 years) (Rosenfeld 2006) and in the ANCHOR study (age=76.0, range = 53-97) (BrownConcomitant topical medications (topical anesthetic and antibiotic) given during the injection ofVEGF Trap-Eye do not penetrate the sclera and are not expected to interact with Eylea.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 67/83Free VEGF Trap binds VEGF to form a stable, inert complex."
"As with other large proteins, both free and bound VEGF are expected to be cleared by proteolytic catabolism."
"Hepatic and renal impairment do not impact clearance of the drug, nor does VEGF Trap-Eye interfere with drugs metabolized through the hepatic and renal systems.Discontinuation due to adverse eventsA total of 212 (8.6%) subjects discontinued from their study within the first year; the most common reason for discontinuation was withdrawal by subject (84 subjects [3.4%])."
A total of255 (10.4%) subjects prematurely discontinued the study medication within the first year; themost common reason was “withdrawal by subject” (94 [3.8%]).
"Adverse events leading to withdrawal were generally consistent with events associated with disease progression or with the expected consequences of the IVT injection procedure, and were characteristic of AEs observed  in the overall AMD subject population.In pool 1, the most common  TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal   were  retinal  haemorrhage,  reduced  VA,  retinal detachment, CVA, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction, and weresimilar among the treatment groups."
"In pool 2, the TEAEs leading to withdrawal were retinal detachment, abscess in a limb,osteomyelitis, sinusitis, constipation, colon cancer, and cutis laxa."
"The AEs leading to withdrawal in the long-term safety study VGFT-OD-0702 were comparablewith those reported in pools 1 and 2 (macular degeneration, reduced VA, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer)."
"None of the AEs that led to permanent withdrawal of study drug wasjudged by the investigator to be related to study drug.The incidence of TEAEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation in the integrated analysis over the entire study period of 2 years (116 [4.8%] of the 2419 study subjects) was 3.5% in the RQ4 group, 4.2% in the 2Q4 group, 6.5% in the 0.5Q4 group, 4.9% in the 2Q8 group, and 5.2% in the VEGF Trap-Eye combined group."
"Thus, the rate of subjects discontinuing treatment because of AEs over 2 years in the integrated analysis was slightly higher with VEGF Trap-Eye than on treatment with ranibizumab."
"However, the overall discontinuation rate and discontinuations due to an AE remain low in all study groups.Post marketing experienceNot applicable2.6.1."
Discussion on clinical safetyThe exposure and safety database size are considered sufficient to allow the safety evaluation.The safety assessment conducted by the applicant in the 2 pivotal studies is appropriate.
"When safety results are pooled from these studies, the rate of ocular and non-ocular TEAEs seems similar between VEGF Trap-Eye and comparator groups."
"In term of ocular TEAEs, the rate of conjunctival hemorrhage, vitreous floaters and IOP increase was slightly higher in the comparator group in pool 1, while Visual acuity was more reduced in VEGF Trap Eye groups."
The number of severe ocular TEAEs is low and similar between the treated groups in pool 1.
Three cases of cataract were reported in VEGF Trap-eye groups and none in ranibizumab group.
"CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 68/83Five cases of endophtalmitis, 2 for VEGF Trap-Eye and 3 for ranibizumab, have been observed."
All were considered related to the study drug.
"This event is covered by sections 4.4. and 4.8. of the SmPC and is mentioned as an important identified risk in the RMP.For vascular disorders, hypertension appeared with similar rates between the ranibizumab and VEGF Trap-eye groups (7.9% vs 6.5%)."
"In pool 1 (SOC and PT), the overall rate of arterial thromboembolic events was higher in VEGF Trap-eye groups (3.2%) compared to 1.8% in ranibizumab group."
"Taking into account the fact that almost 20% of drug substance goes through the systemic circulation, systemic effects of VEGF Trap-eye on the circulation cannot be excluded, and appropriate monitoring is foreseen in the RMP.The number of cerebrovascular events was higher in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups (35) compared with ranibizumab (2 cases) in the elderly, especially in the sub-group ≥ 85 years (20 vs 1 case), during the first year of treatment."
Two-year data showed also the increased number of cerebrovascular events in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups vs ranibizumab: 53 vs 12 (27 vs 3 in the sub-group ≥ 85 years).
One death due to CVA in the 0.5Q4 group and one death due to ischemic stroke in the 2Q8 group were considered as treatment related.
"Among severe non-ocular TEAEs, TIA (transient ischemic attack) was observed in 10 patients treated with VEGF Trap-eye, while no cases occurred in comparator group."
The majority of these subjects had pre-existing risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
No subject had a positive anti-drug antibody status.
"Since subjects were randomised to treatment, it is reasonable to assume that there would be an equal prevalence of risk factors in those assigned to ranibizumab."
Arterial thromboembolic events are listed as an important potential risk in the RMP and covered in sections 4.4 and  4.8 of the SmPC.
The higher proportion of TIAs and cerebrovascular events reported within the pooled data is of concern and will be carefully considered within further assessments of ATEs during routine pharmacovigilance procedures and PSURs.No specific studies have been provided in renal and hepatic insufficiency; nor specific interaction studies have been performed.From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.2.6.2.
"Conclusions on the clinical safetyOverall, the safety profile of aflibercept appears to be similar to the already marketed comparator drug, ranibizumab."
"No dose related effect was observed.Concerns were raised on potential role of aflibercept on the arterial thromboembolic events, cerebrovascular events and TIAs."
"As routine pharmacovigilance, these events will be subject to mmonitoring and safety evaluation in each PSUR."
A targeted questionnaire will be used to follow-up on any post-marketing or study reports suspicious for ATEs.The CHMP has also requested additional pharmacovigilance activities in the form of a non-interventional study to assess the safety and real-life treatment practice with aflibercept.Further long term data are expected at the conclusion of extension study VGFT-OD-0910.Educational material for physicians and patients to allow correct use of the product will be prepared.

A full study protocol should be submitted to the CHMP before study initiation.

"(Included in RMP -report 31 Due dateDecember The following additional risk minimisation activities were required:All ophthalmological clinics where EYLEA is expected to be used are provided with a physician information pack containing  physician information which includes the Summary of Product Characteristics, an intravitreal injection procedure video and -pictogram as well as patient information packs."
"The patient information packs include the patient information leaflet, a patient information booklet and an audio-CD."
"The key safety messages of the educational materials are outlined in chapter 4, conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product.2.8."
"User consultationThe results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.Benefit-Risk Balance BenefitsBeneficial effectsNeovascular age-related macular degeneration is a chronic, progressive, degenerative condition affecting the eye, which, left untreated, results in moderate to severe visual loss."
"Potential benefitsof therapies in this area are prevention of progression of vision loss, and improvement of reduced vision."
Anti-angiogenic therapy with the vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor ranibizumab is currently the treatment of choice for neovascular AMD.
"Monthly injections of ranibizumab have been shown to prevent moderate vision loss in over 90% of patients, and improve vision by an average of at least 7 letters after 1 year of treatment, with over 30% of patients gaining at least 15 letters of vision.The sought indication of “treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) for adults” implies a disease modifying effect, in that inhibition of VEGF reduces neovascularisation and vessel leakage, and is accompanied by an improvement in clinical signs and symptoms (macular thickness and vision)."
This is not a first-in-class product and the development program has been designed to demonstrate non-inferiority against an existing VEGF inhibitor.
As such the clinical trials were designed to provide long-term (2-year) data.
The development plan of the anti-VEGF treatment Eylea is satisfactory and in agreement with the historical development of other treatments for Wet AMD.
"As Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is currently the gold standard therapy for patients suffering from wet AMD, it was selected as comparator in the pivotal non-inferiority studies."
"CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 78/83A total of 1217 and 1098 patients were respectively randomized in two pivotal studies, VIEW 1 and VIEW 2."
The choice of the primary criteria was discussed and agreed through scientific advices.
"All criteria or methods used for assessment are well validated for the pathology.The primary endpoint, i.e."
"proportion of subjects maintaining vision at Week 52, was met for all VEGF Trap-Eye treatment regimens and established the non-inferiority of VEGF Trap-Eye to ranibizumab (at a pre-specified 10% margin)."
The statistical test sequence showed confirmatory results with narrow confidence intervals (i.e.
"≤ 3.1% and ≤ 2.6 %, in VIEW 1 and in VIEW 2, respectively)."
"These intervals were well below the more stringent non-inferiority margin of 7% which was recommended by the Scientific Advice in 2007 specifically for the pooled analysis, with respect to the more modest difference with placebo observed for pegaptanib (i.e."
"14%).Data from the two pivotal studies show that injections of VEGF Trap-Eye every 8 weeks (initiated  with three monthly injections) were non-inferior to monthly injections of ranibizumab, with 95% of patients maintaining vision (ie, losing <15 letters) at Year 1."
"Results for the secondary endpoints show further benefits and support the comparable efficacy of the two therapies; subjects gained an average of 8 letters of vision, with 31% gaining at least 15 letters; choroidal neovascularisation area decreased by an average of 4 mm2, and visual function questionnaire test scores improved by an average of 5 points."
These benefits were evident across all subgroups and regions.
The analysis of the change from baseline in ETDRS letter score in the 2Q4 group vs RQ4 group was the first ordered comparison for testing superiority.
"Results, in study VIEW 1, showed superiority of VEGF Trap 2Q4 regimen over ranibizumab (p=0.0054) however, no superiority was found in Study VIEW 2."
Therefore no superiority of Eylea over ranibizumab could be demonstrated.
The 2Q8 regimen was chosen as it reduces the number of injections.The two year results show that the efficacy is maintained over the second year of treatment despite a slight drop in vision (1-2 letters of ETDRS Chart) and stagnation or slight decrease in improvements of the morphologic criteria based on OCT examinations.
"Two Year data from the two pivotal studies show that capped-PRN injections of VEGF Trap-Eye given 8-weekly at entry in Year 1 (2Q8) were non-inferior to capped-PRN injections of ranibizumab, with respectively, 92.4% vs 91.6% of patients maintaining vision at Year 2."
Results for the secondary endpoints show that meaningful benefits were also maintained and support the comparable efficacy of the two therapies.
"Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.The non inferiority over ranibizumab monthly administered was demonstrated by 1-year for all fixed proposed dosages and regimens, i.e."
"0.5Q4, 2Q4 and 2Q8, and these results have been further confirmed at two years."
"But, as no fixed regimen was maintained as comparator in the second year, uncertainties remain whether the proposed fixed 2Q8 regimen offers the best long-term benefit."
Provision of further long term data at the conclusion of study VGFT-OD-0910 should help to elucidate this point.The results of Year 2 of the studies failed in appropriately providing guidance to clinicians in the optimal dosing regimen required to maintain initial improvement in vision.
"Indeed, it is presently not totally clarified whether a rigid dosing schedule with a maximum dosing interval of 8 weeks or retreatment on a capped-PRN basis, are required to maintain the optimal efficacy of VEGF Trap-Eye beyond Year 1."
"The results submitted for the second year using reactive dosing (PRN), instead of  proactive dosing in Year 1, suggest that a part of patients may benefit from less or more frequent dosing than the 2Q8 dosings."
"This is of importance, since the main benefit of this product over the existing standard of care would be the reduced frequency of injections required to produce a CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 79/83similar effect."
"Therefore, the CHMP recommended that this point be further investigated through a post-marketing study.RisksUnfavourable effectsThe safety database for VEGF Trap-Eye has not highlighted any major safety concerns."
"Several of the commonly reported adverse events are associated with the injection procedure and may be considered non-serious or easily manageable (conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain, transient rise in intraocular pressure)."
"Rates of more serious events such as endophthalmitis were low, and there does not appear to be any significant risk of intraocular inflammation."
The risk of clinically significant decrease in visual acuity appeared to be slightly higher in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups than in the ranibizumab control group.
"The most common ocular adverse reactions (in at least 5% of patients treated with Eylea) were conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters and increased intraocular pressure."
"In addition, cases of endophtalmitis have been associated with intravitreal injections of aflibercept as well as retinal detachment, retinal haemorrhage and retinal tear."
"As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with aflibercept."
The number of positive anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was similar between the treatment groups in the pivotal studies.
marketing.Hypertension was a very common non-ocular adverse event.
Hypersensitivity as well as Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) were commonly reported.
One case of transient ischemic attack (TIA) was considered to be related to study drug.
"TEAEs of myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure were reported in low rate."
"These events will specifically be monitored post-Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effectsAflibercept is a recombinant protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors, and acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF with higher affinity than their natural receptors, leading to endothelial cell proliferation and neovascularization."
"With regards to the fact that almost 20% of drug substance goes through the systemic circulation and given the potential role of VEGF in the systemic adverse events, systemic effects of VEGF Trap-eye cannot be excluded."
"Adverse reactions related to this inhibition: hypertension, arterial thromboembolic events, haemorrhage have been reported during the safety review of study data."
It has been postulated that a link exists between use of intravitreal VEGF inhibitors and an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic events.The global rate of arterial thromboembolic events was higher in VEGF Trap-eye groups (3.2%) compared to 1.8% in ranibizumab group.
"The number of cerebrovascular events was significantly higher in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups compared with ranibizumab, especially in the sub-group ≥ 85 years, during the first year of treatment."
Two-year data showed also the increased number of cerebrovascular events and TIAs in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups vs ranibizumab.
"Two deaths (CVA, ischemic stroke) were considered as treatment related."
"The applicant agreed to conduct a non-interventional postmarketing study addressing the risk of ATEs, CVAs, and TIAs.CHMP assessment reportEMA/646256/2012Page 80/83BalanceImportance of favourable and unfavourable effects Data from the two pivotal studies demonstrate that injections of VEGF Trap-Eye every 8 weeks (initiated  three early monthly injections) were non-inferior to monthly injections of ranibizumab, with 95% of patients maintaining vision (ie, losing <15 letters) and established the non-inferiority of VEGF Trap-Eye to ranibizumab (at a pre-specified 10% margin).Results for the secondary endpoints show further benefits and support the comparable efficacy of the two therapies."
These benefits were evident across all subgroups and regions.
The results of Year 2 of the studies failed in appropriately elucidating the optimal dosing regimen required to maintain initial improvement in vision.
This is the subject of a post-authorisation measure.The safety database for VEGF Trap-Eye has not evidenced any unexpected or major safety concerns.

"Results for the secondary endpoints support the comparable efficacy of the two therapies.Results, in study VIEW 1, showed superiority of VEGF Trap 2Q4 regimen over ranibizumab (p=0.0054) however, no superiority was found in Study VIEW 2."
"Therefore no superiority for the 2Q8 regimen over ranizumab was demonstrated.The CHMP would like to further elucidate the optimal dosing to be used beyond one year of treatment, as uncertainties remain."
A post-marketing study will be performed by the Applicant.
